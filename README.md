# BM Helper

BondMachine Helper is a tool created to help the user in creating projects using the bondmachime framework and to automate all the various procedures necessary to configure projects without having difficulties.

### Build the executable
In this repo, under *pkg_output* folder, you can find the executable already up to date. But if you want to build the executable from scratch, you can use the following commands:
```
npm i 
npm run compile && npm run build
```
and you will find the executable inside the *pkg_output* folder.
